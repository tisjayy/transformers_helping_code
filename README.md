# Vision Transformer & Self-Attention Example

This repository contains example implementations of core Transformer components — **Self-Attention** and **Vision Transformer (ViT)** — using TensorFlow and Keras. These can be used as building blocks for models handling images, sequential data, or other applications.

Patch Embedding
The input image is divided into smaller fixed-size patches (e.g., 16×16 pixels).

Each patch is flattened into a vector and projected into a fixed-dimensional embedding space (embed_dim).

This process converts image patches into “tokens” similar to words in NLP models.
| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `patch_size`  | Height and width of each patch (e.g., 16 means 16×16 pixels per patch).                                                              |
| `embed_dim`   | Dimensionality of each patch embedding vector.                                                                                       |
| `num_patches` | Number of patches extracted from the image (depends on image size and patch size).                                                   |
| `num_heads`   | Number of attention heads in the MultiHeadAttention layer. Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously. |
| `ff_dim`      | Number of units in the feed-forward layer within each Transformer block (usually larger than `embed_dim`).                           |
| `num_layers`  | Number of stacked Transformer blocks (depth of the model).                                                                           |
| `num_classes` | Number of output classes for classification tasks.                                                                                   |
| `rate`        | Dropout rate used for regularization to prevent overfitting.                                                                         |
